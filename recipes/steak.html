    <ul>

        <li>
            2 (12-oz) New York strip or ribeye steaks or 4 (6-oz)
        </li>
        
        <li>
            (6-oz) filet mignons, about 1½ inches thick
        </li>

        <li>
            1 heaping teaspoon kosher salt
        </li>

        <li>
            ½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
        </li>

        <li>
            2 tablespoons vegetable oil
        </li>

        <li>
            1 tablespoon unsalted butter
        </li>

        <li>
            A few sprigs fresh thyme leaves
        </li>

    </ul>
    
    
    <h3>PAN STAKE</h3>
    
    <p>istructions</p>

    <ol>
        <li>
            To begin, pat the steaks dry with paper towels.

        </li>

        <li>
            Season the steaks all over with the salt and pepper.

        </li>

        <li>
            Turn on your exhaust fan and heat a heavy pan (preferably cast iron or stainless steel) over medium-high heat until it's VERY hot.
        </li>

        <li>
            Add the oil to the pan and heat until it begins to shimmer and move fluidly around the pan.

        </li>

        <li>
            Carefully set the steaks in the pan, releasing them away from you so the oil doesn’t splatter in your direction. The oil should sizzle.

        </li>

        <li>
            Leave the steaks alone! Avoid the temptation to peek or fiddle or flip repeatedly; the steaks need a few minutes undisturbed to develop a golden crust. Flip the steaks when they release easily and the bottom is a deep-brown color, about 3 minutes. Continue to cook the steaks for another 3 to 4 minutes on the second side for rare to medium-rare. (For medium, cook 4 to 5 minutes on second side; for well-done, cook 5 to 6 minutes on second side).

        </li>

        <li>
            During the last minute of cooking, add the butter and thyme sprigs to the pan with the steaks.

        </li>

        <li>

            If you are serving the steaks unsliced, transfer them to plates and serve hot. If you plan to slice the steaks, transfer them to a cutting board and let rest, covered with aluminum foil, for 5 to 10 minutes; then slice thinly against the grain.

        </li>

    </ol>
